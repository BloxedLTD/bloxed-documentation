A performant and configurable scraping platform with untrackable fingerprinting.
Written in: Rust, Golang, Python and Typescript. Postgres and Redis stack are used for data stores.

**Tasks** provide a simple method of scraping and instantly getting the result.

**In/Out** Scraping provides the extracted data as a response to the inital API request.

On user sign-up, an **organization** is created and the user is assigned as the 'owner'.

All interactions related to that organization with the API must use the organization_id within the route.

A 'default' project is also generated for each organization on creation. This is used by default when one is not provided for scraping.

## Organizations:
- Currently there is a one-to-one relationship with users to organizations. For every user, they are the owner and member of a single organization.
- All payment and address information is associated with the organization, not the user. Although it must be provided on user creation.
- Currently all notifications are scoped to the owner of the organization only.
