A performant and configurable scraping platform with untrackable fingerprinting.

Written in: Rust, Golang, Python and Typescript. Postgres and Redis stack are used for data stores.

**Tasks**: Provide a simple method of scraping and instantly getting the result.

**In/Out Scraping**: Provides the extracted data as a response to the inital API request.

## Organizations

- On user sign-up, an **organization** is created and the user is assigned as the owner.

- All interactions related to that organization with the API must use the organization_id within the route.
  For example: `https://api.bloxed.com/1.0/private/user/{{organization_id}}/payment_method/search`

- A default project is generated for each organization on creation. This is used when one is not provided for scraping.

- Currently there is a **one-to-one** relationship with users to organizations. For every user, they are the owner and member of a single organization.

- All payment and address information is associated with the organization, not the user.

- Currently all notifications are scoped to the owner of the organization only.
