Bloxed is an **all-in-one web-scraping platform**. Making handling proxies, 
fingerprinting, data-cleaning, parsing, and processing accessible through a low-code platform and robust SDKs.

#### In/Out Scraping 
The Bloxed API and SDK takes in a **task pipeline** and returns the data you need from a webpage as the response to the initial request.

#### Task
You can send Bloxed web-scraping instructions, it will then return the data you requested from that site in real-time.

## Organizations
- Upon sign-up, a **personal Organization** is created and the User is assigned as the owner.

- All interactions related to that Organization with the API must use the organization_id within the route.
  For example: `https://api.bloxed.com/1.0/private/user/{{organization_id}}/task/create`

- A default **project** is generated for each Organization on creation. This is used automatically when not provided.

- Currently there is a **one-to-one** relationship with users to organizations. For every User, they are the owner and member of a single Organization.

- All payment and address information is associated with the Organization, not the User.

- All notifications are scoped to the owner of the Organization only.
