A **geo-fingerprint** is an object that exists globally to all users and is not scoped to a specific organization.

This fingerprint can be used to generate residential, isp and datacenter proxies, along with geo-specific data such as the language/timezone of the browser.
```json
    {
        "city_alias": "lon",
        "country_id": "gb",
        "geo_fingerprint_proxy_type": "isp"
    }
```

The **device** fingerprint contains information about the fingerprint that the browser will use to try and replicate specific devices.
This uses [apify's fingerprint suite](https://github.com/apify/fingerprint-suite) to modify: headers, screen parameters, gpu, cpu, memory size, fonts, webrtc and other navigator properties.

A custom fingerprint object can be used:
```json
    {   
        "device_fingerprint_name": "linux_desktop",
        "device_fingerprint_description": "Fingerprint for linux desktop",
        "device_fingerprint_device": "desktop",
        "device_fingerprint_operating_system": "linux",
        "device_fingerprint_browser": "chrome",
        "device_fingerprint_locale": "en-GB",
        "device_fingerprint_user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/129.0.6668.89 Safari/537.36",
    }
```
