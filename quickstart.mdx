The Bloxed Web Scraping Platform is segmented into four sections of our **[pipeline](/pipeline)** as shown below.

```mermaid
  flowchart LR
    scraping[<a href='/pipeline/scraping/instructions'>Scraping</a>] --> processing
    processing[<a href='/pipeline/processing'>Processing</a>] --> formatting[<a href='/pipeline/formatting'>Formatting</a>]
    formatting --> egress[<a href='/pipeline/egress'>Egress</a>]
```

The **Scraping** section is where the **url** and **[fingerprint](/metadata/fingerprint)** are defined. In addition to this any **[instructions](/pipeline/scraping/instructions)** that are required to navigate the page and **[extract](/pipeline/scraping/instructions#extraction)** the data that you require.

The simplest form of web-scraping will only require the extraction instructions.

These objects require **selector** and **output** fields.

In this example you can see that we are extracting the **text** data from the \
selector `[data-cy='price-recipe'] .a-offscreen`


The format is a pipe seperated string `"css_selector|variant"`

Variants include: **text**, **html**, @[attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes)
