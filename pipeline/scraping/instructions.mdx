These can be used to navigate a page, send data and receive data.

Each instruction contains an **action**, such as click, wait and scroll. Most will also have a **variant** such as single and double for the click action.

If the instruction references a specific item on the page, this can be done with the "selector" field. This can be either a CSS selector or XPath.

#### Extraction
```json
    {
        "action": "extraction",
        "selector": {css selector/xpath|target},
        "output": "example_output_key",
        "start": 0,
        "end": 20,
        "crawl": true
    }
```

**Selector** is used to reference the element on the page that you wish to extract from.

**Target** is the part of the element you wish to extract, most of the time this will be **text**. Alternatively, any attribute can be extract with @{attribute_name}. For example @href will get any hrefs (urls) in an element.\
 - **Shorthand** this can be appended to the selector with a pipe (|).
 - **Longhand** this should be provided under the key, 'target'. e.g.
```json
    {
        "action": "extraction",
        "selector": ".textbox",
        "target": "text",
        "output": "example_output_key",
        "range": "1:9"
    }
```

**Output Key** is the key that the output will be assigned to in the output object.

**Range** this **optional** field allows the extraction of multiple items at once that have the same selector. If no range is provided, it will return all results.
This cant be provided in two ways. Shorthand and Longhand (shown above).
 - **Shorthand** is provided under the key 'range' with colon seperated values. e.g.
```json
    {
        "action": "extraction",
        "selector": {css selector/xpath|type},
        "output": "example_output_key",
        "range": "1:9"
    }
```

#### Click
```
    {
        "action": "click",
        "variant": "single" or "double",
        "selector": "{css_selector}"
    }
```
#### Wait
```
    {
        "action": "wait",
        "variant": "timeout" or "element",
        "duration": "{time in ms}", (only if variant is timeout)
        "selector": "{css_selector}" (only if variant is element)
    }
```
#### Screenshot
```
    {
        "action": "screenshot",
        "variant": "full" or "window" or "element",
        "selector": "{css_selector}" (only if variant is element)
    }
```
#### Scroll
```
    {
        "action": "scroll",
        "variant": "to" or "by",
        "selector": "{css_selector}" (only if variant is to)
        "delta_x": {pixel count}, (only if variant is by - can be emitted if zero)
        "delta_y": {pixel count} (only if variant is by - can be emitted if zero)
    }
```
#### Input
```
    {
        "action": "input",
        "variant": "fill" or "extend", (overwrite or extend existing content)
        "selector": "{css_selector}",
        "value": "{text_value}"
    }
```

If no instructions are specified, the page HTML will be returned.

#### Iterate
```
    {
        "action": "Iterate",
        "group_output": "{output name of the group}",
        "parent_selector": "{css select of the parent group}",
        "instructions": [{any instructions previously mentioned}]
    }
```

In order to group the execution of instructions we have the ability to "iterate".

This will execute the instructions provided within all instances of the parent selector.
Any extraction done in this will be be output within that "group_output" key.
