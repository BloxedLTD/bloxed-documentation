For all variants of the data cleaning module:
- **Input** is a list of scopes to the data you would like to transform.
- **Output** is a list of output key that you would like to write the new data to. (**one-to-one** relationship with inputs).
- **Recurse** allows for recursion through every part of the element (from the scope provided).
- **Error On Fail** lets you choose if failure of a data clean (i.e an invalid index) will cause an error to occur or just be ignored.

<Info>
If no output is given, the new data will overwrite the original input key
