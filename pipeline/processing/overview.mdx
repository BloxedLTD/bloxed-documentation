Processing is an array of module objects.

Available Modules:
- [Data Cleaning](pipeline/processing/data_cleaning)



#### Required Fields
For **all** variants, the following are required: 
- **input** (**string**) -> List of output keys from extraction
- **output** (**string**) -> List of keys for new outputs, if left blank the inputs will be overwritten

#### Optional Fields
- Recurse (**bool**) -> Cleaning will recursively apply to all parts of the inputs. (**false** by default)

#### Scoping
**Keys:** Named sections in a path (e.g., product, prices).\
**Arrays:** Represent an entire array ([]).\
**Indexes:** A specific position in an array (e.g., [0], [4]).\
**Slices:** A range of indices in an array (e.g., [1:3]).

#### Example
```json
{
    "products": {
        "prices": ["$1.00","$5.00","$5.00", "$6.00", "$2.00"]
    }
}
```

To extract prices in the range 1-3. The scope would be: **products.prices.[1:3]**

Or

To scope all price elements. The scope would be: **products.prices.[]**

#### Nested example
```json
{
    "products": [
        [
            "a", "b", "c"
        ],
        [
            "d", "e", "f"
        ]
    ]
}
```
To get the second element in the first product array would be: **products.[0].[1]**
